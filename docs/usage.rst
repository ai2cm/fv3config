Usage

Quickstart
----------

The following code would write a default run directory::

    from fv3config import get_default_config, write_run_directory

    config = get_default_config()
    write_run_directory(config, './rundir')

:code:`config` is a configuration dictionary which contains namelists, input data specifications,
and other options. It can be edited just like any dictionary. Namelists are specified as
sub-dictionaries. A default configuration dictionary can be retrieved with
:py:func:`fv3config.get_default_config`, and a run directory can be written
using :py:func:`fv3config.write_run_directory`.

Data Caching
------------

:code:`fv3config` writes run directories by symbolically linking cached data files into the directory.
Before this data can be linked, it must be downloaded. This can be done form the command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m fv3config.download_data

Or from inside Python::

    from fv3config import ensure_data_is_downloaded

    ensure_data_is_downloaded()

It is also possible to delete and re-download the data archive, in case something goes wrong::

    $ python -m fv3config.refresh_data

Cache Location
--------------

If the FV3CONFIG_CACHE_DIR environment variable is set, the package will download
and store data into ``$(FV3CONFIG_CACHE_DIR)/fv3config-cache``.
If unset, by default the package will use the "user cache" directory for the user's
operating system.

The download location can be retrieved using :py:func:`fv3config.get_cache_dir`, and set
manually using :py:func:`fv3config.set_cache_dir`. Note that the "fv3config-cache" subdirectory
will be appended to the cache directory you set. If the target is set to a directory
that already contains the archive download, it will automatically start using those
files. Conversely, if the target is set to an empty directory, it will be necessary
to re-download the cache files.

It's unlikely, but do not set the cache directory to a location that already contains
a "fv3config-cache" subdirectory with unrelated files, or the cache files will not
download until you call :py:func:`fv3config.refresh_downloaded_data` (which will delete any files
in the subdirectory).

Configuration
-------------

The ``config`` dictionary must have at least the following items:

==================== ======== ==================== ========================
Key                  Type     Default              Other built-in options
==================== ======== ==================== ========================
namelist             Namelist default Namelist     none
experiment_name      str      'default_experiment' n/a
diag_table           str      'default'            'grid_spec', 'no_output'
data_table           str      'default'            none
initial_conditions   str      'gfs_example'        'restart_example'
forcing              str      'default'            none
==================== ======== ==================== ========================

In addition to one of the built-in options, a custom ``diag_table`` and ``data_table`` can be specified
by supplying a path to a file. Custom ``initial_conditions`` and ``forcing`` can be specified by
supplying a path to a directory that contains the appropriate files. Paths to files or directories on the local
filesystem must be given as absolute paths. If paths are given that begin with ``gs://`` then ``fv3config`` will
attempt to download the specified file or files from Google Cloud Storage. For this functionality, ``gcsfs``
must be installed and authorized to download from the specified bucket.

The ``namelist`` item is special in that it is explicitly stored in the ``config`` dictionary. For the
fv3gfs model, individual namelists are specified for various components of the model. As an example, the
vertical resolution can be accessed via ``config['namelist']['fv_core_nml']['npz']``.

Some helper functions exist for editing and retrieving information from configuration
dictionaries, like :py:func:`fv3config.get_run_duration` and
:py:func:`fv3config.set_run_duration`. See the :ref:`API Reference` for more details.

Specifying individual files
---------------------------

More fine-grained control of the files that are written to the run-directory is possible using the "asset"
representation of run-directory files. An asset is a dictionary that knows about one files's source
location/filename, target filename, target location within the run directory and whether that file is copied or linked.
Asset dicts can be generated with the helper function :py:func:`fv3config.get_asset_dict`. For example::

    >>> get_asset_dict('/path/to/filedir/', 'sample_file.nc', target_location='INPUT/')
    {'source_location': '/path/to/filedir/',
    'source_name': 'sample_file.nc',
    'target_location': 'INPUT/',
    'target_name': 'sample_file.nc',
    'copy_method': 'copy'}

One can set ``config['initial_conditions']`` or ``config['forcing']``
to a list of assets in order to specify every initial condition or forcing file individually.

One can use a directory to specify the initial conditions or forcing files and replace only a
subset of the files within the that directory with the optional ``config['patch_files']`` item.
All assets defined in ``config['patch_files']`` will overwrite any files specified in the
initial conditions or forcing if they have the same target location and name.


Running the model with fv3run
-----------------------------

`fv3config` provides a tool for running the python-wrapped model called `fv3run`.
For example, you can run the default configuration using first::

    $ docker pull us.gcr.io/vcm-ml/fv3gfs-python

to acquire the docker image for the python wrapper, followed by
a call to :py:func:`fv3config.run_docker`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import fv3config
    >>> config = fv3config.get_default_config()
    >>> fv3config.run_docker(config, 'outdir', docker_image='us.gcr.io/vcm-ml/fv3gfs-python')

If the ``fv3gfs-python`` package is installed natively, the model could be run
using :py:func:`fv3config.run_native`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> fv3config.run_native(config, 'outdir')

The python config can be passed as either a configuration dictionary, or the name of
a yaml file. There is also a bash interface for running from yaml configuration.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fv3run --help
    usage: fv3run [-h] [--runfile RUNFILE] [--dockerimage DOCKERIMAGE]
                  [--keyfile KEYFILE]
                  config outdir

    Run the FV3GFS model. Will use google cloud storage key at
    $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS by default.

    positional arguments:
      config                location of fv3config yaml file
      outdir                location to copy final run directory

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --runfile RUNFILE     location of python script to execute with mpirun
      --dockerimage DOCKERIMAGE
                            if passed, execute inside a docker image with the
                            given name
      --keyfile KEYFILE     google cloud storage key to use for cloud copy
                            commands

The only required inputs are ``config``, which specifies a yaml file containing the
``fv3config`` run directory configuration, and a final location to copy the run directory.
A keyfile can be specified to authenticate Google cloud storage for any data sources
located in Google cloud buckets, or the key is taken from an environment variable
by default. If ``dockerimage`` is specified, the command will run inside a Docker
container based on the given image name. This assumes the ``fv3config`` package and
``fv3gfs`` python wrapper are installed inside the container, along with any
dependencies.

The python interface is very similar to the command-line interface, but is split into
separate functions based on where the model is being run.

Customizing the model execution
-------------------------------

The ``runfile`` is the python script that will be executed by mpi, which
typically imports the ``fv3gfs`` module, and then performs some time stepping.
The default behavior is to use a pre-packaged runfile which reproduces the
behavior of Fortran model identically. For additional, flexibility a custom
runfile can be specified as an argument to all the ``run_`` functions.


The environmental variable ``FV3CONFIG_DEFAULT_RUNFILE`` can be used to override
the default runfile. If set, this variable should contain the path of the
runfile.

.. note::

  When using ``run_docker`` or ``run_kubernetes``, the value of
  ``FV3CONFIG_DEFAULT_RUNFILE`` and the file it points to will be read inside the
  docker image where execution occurs. It will have no effect if set on the host
  system outside of the docker image.

Submitting a Kubernetes job
---------------------------

A python interface :py:func:`fv3config.run_kubernetes` is provided for
submitting `fv3run` jobs to Kubernetes. Here's an example for submitting a job
based on the default configuration dictionary::

    import yaml
    import gcsfs
    import fv3config

    config_location = 'gs://my_bucket/fv3config.yml'
    outdir = 'gs://my_bucket/rundir'
    docker_image = 'us.gcr.io/vcm-ml/fv3gfs-python'
    config = fv3config.get_default_config()

    fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()  # project name is optional,
                                # we don't use commands that depend on it
    with fs.open(config_location, 'w') as config_file:
        config_file.write(yaml.dump(config))

    fv3config.run_kubernetes(
        config_location,
        outdir,
        docker_image,
        gcp_secret='gcp-key'  # replace with your kubernetes secret
                              # containing gcp key in key.json
    )

The gcp key is generally necessary to gain permissions to read and write from google
cloud storage buckets. In the unlikely case that you are writing to a public bucket,
it can be ommitted.

Restart runs
------------

The required namelist settings for a restart run (as opposed to a run initialized from an observational
analysis) can be applied to a configuration dictionary as follows::

    config = enable_restart(config)

A set of restart files is provided in the cached data files. Thus, an example run directory with model
restart initial conditions can be created with::

    from fv3config import get_default_config, write_run_directory, enable_restart

    config = get_default_config()
    config['initial_conditions'] = 'restart_example'
    config = enable_restart(config)
    write_run_directory(config, './rundir')
